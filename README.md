# Bookz

App that lets users explore new books!

## Introduction

As a first-time Svelte user, I recently had the opportunity to build a web application using SvelteKit and Prisma. The application includes features such as authentication, book database management, the ability to add books to reading lists, and the display of individual book pages. I used Lucia for authentication and an external API for the book data.

### Features

One of the key features of the application is the authentication system built with Lucia. Lucia provided a simple and intuitive way to handle user authentication, allowing users to create accounts and log in securely. With Lucia, I was able to integrate authentication seamlessly into the application, and it allowed me to focus on other aspects of the application's development.

Another feature of the application is the ability to add books to the database. I used an external API to pull in book data and store it in the database using Prisma. Prisma provided a simple and intuitive way to work with the database, allowing me to create and update records with ease.

Users can add books to their reading list or finished list. The application also displays individual book pages, where users can view more information about a particular book, such as a summary, author bio, and reviews. The individual book pages were built using SvelteKit's page-based routing system, allowing me to create dynamic routes for each book page.

## Summary

Overall, building this web application with SvelteKit and Prisma was a great experience. SvelteKit was easy to learn and use, and it allowed me to build a fast and responsive application quickly. Prisma made it easy to work with the database, and Lucia provided a great authentication solution. I look forward to using SvelteKit and Prisma for future projects.
